StairCases
==========

Overview
--------
This project is an exercise in java syntax, control, and thinking. It gets an integer input from the user and prints ascending and descending staircases of 'x' characters. The program is restricted to only use a single literal which is either the char 'x' or the String "x".

For example, if the user supplies the number 3, the program will print
<pre>
*
**
***

***
**
*
</pre>

Usage
-----
Compile the program with:
`javac StairCases.java`

Run the compiled bytecode with:
`java StairCases`
