StairCases
==========

Overview
--------
This project is an exercise in java syntax, control, and thinking. It gets an integer input from the user and prints ascending and descending staircases of 'x' characters. The program is restricted to only use the following literals:
 * Either the char or String 'x', "x", or "x "
 * Small integers to initialize counters
 * A single string to prompt the user for input

For example, if the user supplies the number 3, the program will print
<pre>
x
xx
xxx

xxx
xx
x
</pre>

Usage
-----
Compile the program with:
`javac StairCases.java`

Run the compiled bytecode with:
`java StairCases`
